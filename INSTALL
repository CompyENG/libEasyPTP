Basic Installation Instructions
===============================

libEasyPTP, at the moment, requires no configuration script.  Simply run:
make install
To build and install the library.  This will install to /usr.  If you would
like to install to a different location, you can edit Makefile.  This 
command will most likely need to be run as root.
